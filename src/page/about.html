                <p>
                    Hey! I'm Zaky Adwa Rifqi, born and raised in Tuban, East Java, Indonesia — a small town with simple vibes. I'm currently a student at SMK Negeri 1 Tuban, and a self-taught frontend developer who discovered coding in the middle of heartbreak.
                    Yeah, really.

                    After a rough breakup, I needed a distraction — something to focus on besides my thoughts. That's when I found a YouTube channel called Web Programming UNPAS by Pak Sandhika Galih, and thought, "Why not learn something new?" So I opened up my browser, typed some HTML, styled it with CSS, and boom — my healing process began.
                    
At first, it was just for fun. But the more I explored, the more I fell in love with how websites work. There's something magical about turning lines of code into something you can see, click, and interact with. What started as a random escape turned into a true passion.

Right now, I'm focusing on native web development — HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. I haven't touched frameworks like React or Vue yet, because I believe understanding the fundamentals deeply will make everything else easier later on.

I'm still learning, but I'm excited about the journey ahead. I love creating clean and responsive user interfaces that not only look good but also provide a great user experience.

I'm especially passionate about creating websites that are:
- Interactive
- User-friendly
- Visually engaging, with smooth animations and clean layouts

My very first project was a simple clicking game, which taught me the joy of building something functional — even if it was small. That experience gave me the confidence to keep going, to learn more, and to start building with purpose.

One fun fact about me? Sometimes I get ideas for solving code problems while gaming. Like mid-match, an idea just pops up — and I'll immediately open VS Code, and write it down before it disappears. Coding has become more than a skill; it's a part of my daily rhythm now.
I may be early in my journey, but I'm committed to learning, growing, and creating things that people enjoy using. One step at a time, one project at a time.
Still learning. Still building. Always curious.
